# README

This App's purpose is to provide the user a way to search marijuana strains and save their picks in the Favorites table in the database. Ideally the API resource would have info on the strains physical and mental effects.
To use the App an User signs in to create an account or logs in on the home user#index page with an email and password. That directs  them to the favorites#index where a list of strains appear generated from the Otreeba API. This displays the strain name and picture with links to more info and a save button. Once saved the user is directed to the favorites#show that displays that favorite.
Then by using the Navbar menu by clicking on 'See Favorites' the user is directed to the users#show page that diplays all yheir favorites with links to edit or delete each one.
